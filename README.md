# 5day_GenAI_Google
Material from the intensive GEN-AI course hosted by Google and kaggle from 11/11 to 15/11/24

Google and Kaggle hosted aN intensive course on GEN AI. It was focused on how to use gemini API and the tools created by google to tackle real world problems.

This coursed is designed to be completed in 5 days. Each day you should read a whitepaper about a topic related to GEN AI, attend the livestream to gain more knowledge and complete one or more code labs using jupyter notebooks and Gemini API

I am only compiling the material since I would have wanted to have access to this information before. Hopefully someone will find this useful. If you want to go further please check the suggested links in each notebook
