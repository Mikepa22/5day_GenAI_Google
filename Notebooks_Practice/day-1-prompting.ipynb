    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

       "**What it is:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Git prompt customization:** It adds information about your current Git repository to your Bash prompt, such as:\n",
       "    * Branch name (e.g., `(main)`).\n",
       "    * Status (e.g., `(1 modified, 1 untracked)`)\n",
       "    * Upstream status (e.g., `(ahead 2)`)\n",
       "    * Detached head state (e.g., `(detached HEAD)`)\n",
       "    * Optional: username and repo URL \n",
       "* **Themes:** It allows you to customize the colors of your prompt using themes.\n",
       "* **Configuration:**  It provides options to customize the prompt's appearance and behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why you would use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Improve Git workflow:** Having Git information readily visible in your prompt makes it easier to track your work and the state of your repository.\n",
       "* **Enhanced clarity:**  Provides more context about the Git environment you're working in.\n",
       "* **Personalized experience:** Offers many customization options for the appearance and information displayed in your prompt.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it works (at a high level):**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Initialization:** The script defines functions and sets up initial variables.\n",
       "2. **Theme loading:** It determines the active theme and loads the corresponding color scheme.\n",
       "3. **Git status:** It retrieves the current Git status using `git` commands.\n",
       "4. **Prompt construction:** It formats the prompt string by combining information from Git status, themes, and user settings.\n",
       "5. **Hooking into Bash:** It integrates the generated prompt into your Bash prompt by modifying the `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary:**  \"git-prompt.sh\" is a Bash script that makes your Git workflow more efficient and visually appealing by enriching your Bash prompt with Git information and customization features. \n"
